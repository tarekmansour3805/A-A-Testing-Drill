5. To prevent cheating, a teacher writes three versions of a test. She stacks the three versions together, first all copies of Version A, 
then all copies of Version B, then all copies of Version C. As students arrive for the exam, each student takes a test. When grading 
the test, the teacher finds that students who took Version B scored higher than students who took either Version A or Version C. She concludes from this that Version B is easier, and discards it.


the problem:
how to pile up papers?

Potential Solution:
Creating three different copies of the exams will decrease the amount of cheating on exams, but testing wheather the success rate of the exam increases when giving a logical ordered 
exam to the students. meaning instead of puting pills on top of each other, have the exams sorted out in a logical order 1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3.


method of testing:
create two scenarios, where one the exam papers are pilled up, and the other where there's a logical order to them
check the answers of all students, if the rates have decreased from scenario one to scenario two then this is the solution to decrease the amount of cheating on exams.
